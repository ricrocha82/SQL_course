-- SELECT column_name FROM tabel_name
-- SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_x
-- SELECT * = all the table (only if you want all the table bc it will increase time processing)

-- LIKE = case sensitive

-- WHERE name LIKE '%a'

-- _ = matches any single character (just a single character)

-- can use more than one _
-- WHERE value LIKE 'VERSION_____'

-- we can combine both
